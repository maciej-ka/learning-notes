## Introduction to Next.js, v3
https://frontendmasters.com/courses/next-js-v3/  
https://nextjs.org/docs  
https://scottmoss.notion.site/Intro-to-Next-js-V3-6cefbdba58d94e3897dcb8d7e7fc0337

#### History of react and next.js
2023 React started recommending Next.js as a way to start new projects.

React is probably not the fastest and best framework  
but its most popular it has biggest community

Its more a library than framework. Its only about components.  
Its not so complete as Angular (router, state).  
This allows for flexibility.

When you're a big company you don't want to go Open Source shopping.  
And rely on open source router written in basement.  
You will be better with Angular or ... Next.js

Qwik: reminds jQuery, but has more speed and organization.

#### SPA Single Page Application
single page, switching components in place, no full page reload

downsides:  
its slow because browser has to download all the content  
and it has problems with crawlers, google but also facebook preview

#### SSR Server Side Rendering
same like SPA but different first step  
initial render happens on the server, render it to html, no js dowload  
load javascript in the background and when ready, swap

downsides:  
for page interactivity you had to wait for javascript

#### RSC React Server Components
introduced in React 18 and Next.js 13, cool experiment lets see will it stick  
there is no javascript representation of component sent to client  
you can also do all the data fetching while the component is running  
no need to wait for entire bundle of javascript

for interactivity you still need client components  
you can mix parts that are server components and client components  
progressive enhancement: choosing what to download at what moment  
first download whole page, then download javascript for interactive parts

downsides:  
there is no strict separation between client and server  
it can be confusing compared to having separate folder for express

#### Is it like hotwire?
React 18 introduced streaming of html to the client  
Next has different approach, they prerender  
Next doesn't use websocket

#### Tailwind and headless components
Headless components: components that have functionality but no style  
Tailwind: actually its javascript library that generates css

#### Setup Next.js
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-intro-v3
```

#### Prettier config
.prettierrc
```.prettierrc
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "semi": false
}
```

### Dynamic routing
how to express path with ids in filesystem?  
use square brackets  
`/docs/[id]/`

access params in component

```javascript
const Page = ({ params }) => {
  return <div>docs page {params.id}</div>
}
```

#### how to have multiple params?
make another subfolder  
`/docs/[id]/[title]/`

#### catch all
`/docs/[...ids]/`  
ids will be an array

will catch every subroute  
no matter how many segments

it will catch  
/docs/something  
/docs/something/another  
/docs/something/another/one-more

but it will not match  
/docs/

and to fix this, you can do double brackets  
`/docs/[[...ids]]/`




## Learn Next.js
https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app

#### use server
it's possible to have it directly in form action:

```jsx
<form
  action={async () => {
    'use server';
    await signOut();
  }}
>
```

#### Open Graph metadata
metadata: additional details about a webpage  
(typically title, description, favicon and keywords)  
metadata which improves appearene of shared links on social media

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Title Here" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Description Here" />
<meta property="og:image" content="image_url_here" />
```

### Routing
To actually create page that loads under segments  
there has to be a file called `page`.  
it can be page.js, page.ts, page.tsx ...

#### route grouping
a way to combine bunch of routes  
that live in a similar place

imagine dashboard that has navigation on the left  
you have about 30 pages showing different parts of page  
and you want choose some of them close logically and group them  
but you don't want to affect url and introduce new url part

add folder with name in brackets  
`(dashboard)`

because such a folder is ignored  
this may create conflicts of two `page.tsx`  
which will be reported in next error

#### route grouping and layouts
common reason for grouping is also to have layout  
for just some of selected components

#### loading / error
apart from `page` file, which is mandatory for each route folder  
route folders can also have `loading.js` and `error.js`

#### server components
super simple components we were making  
are actually a server components

and anything you can do in node  
you can do in these files

by default everything is server component  
and if you don't want it you have to opt out

#### SSR
react: library to be expressive in how you create uis  
react-dom: it translates react into the browser

ssr: takes component A, turns it into html and sends it to the browser  
but additionally replica of that component A is also sent to the client  
and after some time that replica takes over  
so that way its interactive

1. here is html of component  
2. here is javascript of that component  
3. and a javascript state of that component

*server components*  
they are purely html  
everything is executed on the server  
there is no client side thing taking over  
browser doesn't know there is react component  
and there is no javascript waiting to hydrate it



## Complete Intro to React
https://react-v9.holt.courses/  
https://github.com/btholt/citr-v9-project

currencies built into browser:

```javascript
const intl = new Intl.NumberFormat("en-US", {
  style: "currency",
  currency: "USD",
});
```

it's possible to make react  
without build step

makes sense to add something here  
so that users without js can see some info
```html
<div id="root">not rendered</div>
```

#### react from cdns, no build
unpkg: cdn for package

```html
<div id="root">not rendered</div>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18.3.1/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18.3.1/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
<script src="src/App.js"></script>
```

start http
```bash
npx serve
```
made by vercel

App.js

```javascript
const App = () =>  {
  return React.createElement(
    "div",
    {},
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "PadreGino's")
  )
}

const container = document.getElementById("root")
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(React.createElement(App));
```

component is like a stamp

create Element has two ways  
bo be used, with text or function:

```javascript
React.createElement("h1", {}, "PadreGino's"),
React.createElement(Pizza),
```

to render many, use array

```javascript
return React.createElement("div", {}, [
  React.createElement("h1", {}, "The Pepperoni Pizza"),
  React.createElement("p", {}, "Mozzarella Cheese, Pepperoni"),
])
```

props:

```javascript
const Pizza = (props) => {
  return React.createElement("div", {}, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, props.name),
    React.createElement("p", {}, props.description),
  ])
}

...
React.createElement("h1", {}, "PadreGino's"),
React.createElement(Pizza, { name: "Pepperoni", description: "Peperroni, mozarella cheese" }),
React.createElement(Pizza, { name: "Americano", description: "French fries and hot dogs" }),
```

difference between:  
props: empty / undefined

```javascript
React.createElement(Pizza, {}),
React.createElement(Pizza),
```

a lot of ternary operators in React

.prettierrc  
can be very short:  
`{}`

#### CRA
not recommended anymore in React docs  
(it's opinionated in way you may not like)

#### eslint linting?
mixed feelings  
write any code you like?  
...

balanced view:  
catch very common errors  
otherwise leave me alone

sort imports? one of least favorite rules

current config:  
`eslint.config.mjs`

```javascript
/** @type {import('eslint').Linter.Config[]} */
```
tip for vscode  
to use completions for that type  
(without typescript!)

config
```json
"lint": "eslint"
```
run
```bash
npm run lint -- --fix
```
-- is needed  
without it --fix will be parameter of npm

#### oxlint, Biome
written in Rust, faster than ESLint

https://www.npmjs.com/package/globals  
Global identifiers from different JavaScript environments  
`globals.browser`

#### vite
french for "quick"  
from creator of vue  
has a bundler inside: Rollup  
it's like Parcel, but performant, not friendly

"Rolldown"  
Rust based bundler for javascript

if using cdns, requires type module
```html
<script type="module" src="src/App.js"></script>
```

Next ...  
several layers beneath does webpack

there are not so many bundlers  
`rollup`, `webpack`, `parcel`  
and they are reused a lot
```json
"dev": "vite",
"build": "vite build",
"preview": "vite preview",
```
dev: used the most time  
build: more for github actions  
preview: build as production (debug problem that's only on production)

port number  
5173: in roman numerals V1T3

redirect  
http://localhost:5173/api/pizza  
to  
http://localhost:3000/api/pizza
```json
proxy: {
  "/api": {
    target: "http://localhost:3000",
    changeOrigin: true
  },
}
``````
#### JSX
Was never intended to be used in React.  
used in SolidJS

use jsx or js as extension?  
initially it had to be jsx

Dan Abramov: I just use "js"  
it caused massive swing from jsx to js  
but vite requires it, so its jsx again

reason for "classname" not "class"  
class is reserved word in javascript

same with label for
```html
<label htmlFor="..."
```

this is valid html  
but wrong jsx:  
<input>  
valid jsx:  
<input />

do you have to use
```javascript
import React from "react"
```
it used to be required  
now if file is jsx extension that import is added

lower/upper case  
h1: literally a tag  
H1: a component

### Hooks
before there were class.  
Class are very rarely used.  
It's almost strange how class components are gone.

You don't want anything heavy in render path,  
because it will slow down.

when app crashes, named function:
```javascript
export default function Order () {}
```
will display little better in stack  
then:
```javascript
const Pizza = (props) => {
```

two-way binding  
Angular 1  
but it turns out, it was hard to work  
where this variable comed from?

in comparison, React is very verbose  
but also easy to work

#### order dependent
cannot be inside conditionals

### Strict mode
will run everything twice  
to make sure you don't have side effects

### Dev tools
you can change state just to test  
and also recently it allows to edit props

$0 -> last selected thing in inspector  
$r -> last react component selected in component tree

changing a tab to components after inspector  
will remember last selected and translate it to react

#### React is usually fast enough
apart from moments when you have problem

#### order
first render  
useEffect(..., [])

first render is before  
useEffect will schedule function

### useDebugValue
send some value to Components developers tool for component

### Preconnect / Preload
Apart from lazy and eager load...  
preconnect: open socket and have everything ready for download  
preload: load something you expect

service workers:  
they can work like: here is a map of everything needed  
please preload all

preload and preconnect  
React 19

## Less common hooks
not hooks but also  
`React.Memo`  
`React.formwardRef`

#### useImperativeHandle
not used often  
used with forwardRef  
  use forwardRef to create reference outside component  
  and pass it into component  
it's a way to enable imperative api  
  if something cannot be done in declarative way

```javascript
MessagesDisplay = React.forwardRef(MessagesDisplay)
function MessageDisplay({messages}, ref) { ...
React.useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
  scrollToTop: () => { ... }
  scrollToBottom: () => { ... }
}))
```

for most cases declarative api would be better

#### useLayoutEffect
used similar like useEffect  
when you have side effect which manipulates DOM in a way that is observable  
  designed to handle DOM modifications  
  allows to modify DOM before React paints screen  
  avoids double paint of screen  
also usable when you want to run effect before other effects

#### wrap component in memo:
to avoid rerender when parent renders

#### useCallback(fn, [dep1, dep2])
remember defined function between renders  
may had solved closure callback useRef problems in map  
may be usefull to not trigger effect/memos where fn is dependency

#### useDebugValue(val, formattFn)
show in browser / react tools  
formatterFn - to delay formatting calculation to a moment when debug is visible

#### useDeferredValue(val, initVal)
render with old value  
after that render with new

#### useId
create unique id  
used to be passed to accessibility attributes

```html
<input type="password" aria-describedby={passwordHintId} />
<p id={passwordHintId}>
```

#### useInsertionEffect
useInsertionEffect is for CSS-in-JS library authors.  
useInsertionEffect allows inserting elements into the DOM before any layout Effects fire.

#### useSyncExternalStore
useSyncExternalStore is a React Hook that lets you subscribe to an external store.

```javascript
import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';
export default function ChatIndicator() {
  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);
  return <h1>{isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Disconnected'}</h1>;
}
function getSnapshot() {
  return navigator.onLine;
}
function subscribe(callback) {
  window.addEventListener('online', callback);
  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);
    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);
  };
}
```

#### useTransition
useTransition is a React Hook that lets you update the state without blocking the UI.

```javascript
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()
function selectTab(nextTab) {
  startTransition(() => {
    setTab(nextTab);
  });
}
```

#### error boundary

```javascript
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>...</div>}>
  ...
</ErrorBoundary>
```

#### Suspense
This example assumes you use a Suspense-enabled data source:  
Data fetching with Suspense-enabled frameworks like Relay and Next.js  
<Suspense> lets you display a fallback until its children have finished loading.  
used together with *use*
