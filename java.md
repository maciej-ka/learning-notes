=========================================

Java Spring was inspired by article about problems with Java.  
It's rare case of documentation preceeding code.

Java failed back a bit because it was not opinionated as Rails.  
However Spring has a lot of autoconfiguration, which is optional.

#### who uses Spring
It's easier to talk about who doesn't use Spring  
Google, Twitter, Facebook

#### IDE
JetBrains  
Spring Boot

#### way to start Spring
https://start.spring.io/  
remembers settings  
Maven, JAva, 3.4.4, Jar, 24 Java  
Spring Boot DevTools  
Spring Web  
Spring Boot Actuator  
Spring Data JDBC  
PostgreSQL Driver  
Docker Compose Support  
GraalVM Native Support

there is a way to share setup you like  
curl -G https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz -d dependencies=web,data-jpa -d type=gradle-project -d baseDir=my-dir | tar -xzvf

#### langs
Kotlin is very popular in Java  
Groovy a nice language

#### sdkman.io
great tool to manage Java versions

```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
sdk list java
```

A lot of different vendors of Java  
different implementations.  
Some are value added, some are reimplementation.

we will use  
24-graalce

```bash
sdk install java 24-graalce
sdk default java 24-graalce
```

graalvm.org

```bash
sdk env init
```

this will create .sdkmanrc file  
that will pin version of java used

#### most popular JDK distrubution
Corretto Amazon.  
Most popular because it's default in a lot of places.

#### Liberrica
Another nice one, has a lot of extra support.

#### Spring code, Jurgenization
Code of Spring is legendary,  
it's very backward comp,  
more than linux 

Jurgen: legendary architect  
one of first two people joined Spring  
made a great work of layering abstractions  
that they can handle future changes.

Jurgen is also famous for rewriting PR completely  
"Jurgenization", taking PR, redo it, and merge.

#### run project

```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
sdk install java 24-graalce
sdk default java 24-graalce
git clone https://github.com/joshlong-attic/2025-frontend-masters-spring-boot-course
cd 2025-frontend-masters-spring-boot-course/intro/demo
docker compose up
./mvwn install
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

then visit  
http://localhost:8080/hello

perhaps this should work also...  
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image

#### Build native

```bash
./mvnw -DskipTests -Pnative native:compile
```
