Personal observations (partially in polish)
===========================================
### Ćwicz Ton (jak głośno)
#### nie bądź głośny w doborze tematów
i wątków i wtrętów  
mniej szokersów

#### nie dziel rozmówców
mniej emocjonalnych sądów, które stawiają sprawę tak,  
że można się zgodzić albo nie i podzieli to rozmówców

### Ćwicz Umiar (jak długo)
#### Ile tego umiaru?
dużo w pracy  
trochę w relacjach  
bez umiaru w przemyśleniach

#### W praktyce
czasami najlepszym dokończeniem zdania jest cisza  
bez bo...

#### Umiar a przygotowanie do rozmowy
przeszkadzają za bardzo zaplanowane wypowiedzi  
pomaga fact check i przemyślane stanowisko

#### Umiar a cisza
Im więcej umiaru, tym więcej ciszy  
Nie gnaj w rozmowie  
W ciszy  
  zadaj pytanie  
  otwarte pytanie  
    "jakim słowem byś określił rynek dziś?"  
  powiedz coś miłego rozmówcy  
  spójrz na agendę, jeśli spisana

#### Bądź świadom czasu
Spoglądaj na zegarek,  
pamiętaj, że czas to cenny, wspólny zasób  
nie zagarniaj go całego dla siebie

### Interview
20 lessons from 20 years of magic  
(minds are preloaded, pitching, aesthetics)  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHHg99hwQGY

#### pitching
skill to stand in front of people  
and sell your story

don't talk at your audience  
you want to talk with them  
you want to get your audience ask questions  
- he's a lawyer but he's also a wild animal.
- what kind of wild animal?
- I'm glad you asked

why?  
people are more invested  
in things that they initiated

people are more tuned in  
because you are answering their question

in game design:  
don't always show the players the things  
you want them to see  
let your players find them

leave room to explore

idea of investment is key component  
of what makes people bond  
so you want to make sure  
you're not always giving to them

#### email po? lepiej nie
bez nalegania na odpowiedź po interview  
bez emaila do pracodawcy

#### różne
- Ćwicz umiar (odpowiesz na więcej pytań w tym samym czasie)
- Potrzebują doświadczonego fachowca. Nie męczącego idealisty, z misją naprawiania świata.
- Ubierz się jak programista, nie manager lub sprzedawca
- Celem rekrutacji jest korzystnie wypełniony formularz, który rekruter wyśle przełożonemu

#### historyjki
na biznesowym zapoznaniu: trochę (budowanie relacji)  
na technicznej rozmowie: raczej wcale

#### introduce
I'm developer for 18 years  
powiedzieć o przeszłości, wybierając rzeczy, które świadczą, że dam radę  
zaadresować największe problemy w ogłoszeniu  
zakończyć tym, gdzie teraz jestem, moja aktualna sytuacja

#### How to respond to "what's your opinion on ..."?
- in my experience ...
- pros and cons
- align with company's needs
- stay concise
- avoid strong emotions

### What question to ask on job interview?
- what tools/practices/approaches things in programming you see value in but think they come with too high price too pay?
- what do you think you do differently than most places?
- what lead you to decision to open this position?
- what would be my first assignment?
- what is your tech stack?
- would it be ok for you if remote also means forrest or travel?
- what have you technologically discovered recently

#### nice ones:
- name up to three books on computer science that had most impact on you
- what are your technological goals for next 1-2 years?
- what are your business goals for next 1-2 years?
- do you have a problem in project that keeps returning?
- do you have a long unsolved problem in project?
- do you have places in code for which there are libraries, but you develop own solution, perhaps because
  - it's a time consuming tool and in long term it's faster that way
  - there would be so much customization code that you may write from scratch as well
  - customization you need is impossible (library is too limited in some areas)
- how many years of experience will have programmers I will work with?
- what opportunities to improve skills will I have in your company?

#### revenge ones:
- what is covariance/bivariance in typescript? when does it matter? what ts syntax is connected to these concepts?
- what's the idea behind red-black trees? where are they used?
- what is dynamic programming? would you know the origin of its name? how many types of it you know? what is typical example of applying them?

#### O'Reilly Software Developer Handbook
I don't hire people who aren't engaged in what they are doing.  
If you don't have list of questions lined up for me, all I hear is: you don't want this job.  
Show interest and initiative. Show that you are already thinking about the job.  
Do a research perhaps 1h. What is a product? Is it selling well? What do other people think about it?  
Check Linkedin, twitter and google about people and product.

### Being confident but not arrogant
- Practice frugality.
- Know your strengths and weaknesses.
- Track successes and failures.
- Be aware of your body language.
- Develop good friendships.
- Talk less, listen more.
- Be mindful of others.

### Kontroluj mowę ciała
mowa to 20% komunikacji  
dobieraj ciało jak dobierasz słowa  
myśl, co mówisz ciałem (gdy ci na tym zależy)  
ćwicz umiar ... odnosi się również do mowy ciała

### Nie przynudzać
więcej akcentować po angielsku  
nie mówić za długo, czekać na pytania

### Live Coding
#### live coding, interview traps
Not in a flow state: embarrased to be so slow  
Afraid of errors: avoiding errors/warnings too much, especially after tech talk where there is no easy fix option  
Need for proving that I can code: urge to jump into coding without plan  
Need to show I work hard: tendency to make solution a hard work, not a smart shortcut

#### live coding general
- put standing microphone on side, use ear plugs
- stop urge to immediatelly start coding
- slow down when keyboard, IDE, linux "panic" (they work, it's you)
- don't be afraid of errors, don't turn off linter
- ... especially after questioning, where you avoid first mistake anwser
- play with interactive mode (console, irb)
- make a plan using commented steps
- think about simpler plan
- pogodzić się z góry, że nie utrafi się proporcji między planowaniem a kodowaniem
- implement

#### prepare for interview
- have a bit of coding before
- train string manipulation functions
- train speaking and coding
- have a fast jest setup with a template of generic test

### Open Source
find issues to contribute:  
- introduce and ask on GitHub Discussions
- review existing PRs
- improve documentations
- add tests
- use software to find ideas
- browse codebase to refactor
- update dependencies
- propose new features
- engage with others
- help resolve issues
- create faq
- improve build or ci

### Feeling low?
try to act physically or creatively:  
- clean basement
- start moving studio out
- repair something
- build something on web



Frontend Masters, Software Developer Success
============================================
https://frontendmasters.com/courses/dev-soft-skills/

### 1. Starting in new project
After joining a project, you want to deliver value  
devs usually want to prove value fast  
ramping

#### in first days
pair programming  
shadowing experienced coworkers for a day  
paired code review  
read docs

asking questions  
starting is best moment for asking questions  
- what are good and bad parts of codebase?
- what patterns to follow, which to avoid?
- what is PR process like? how many reviewers, what kind of feedback?
- what's the pipeline to deployment?
- which documentation are reliable, which are stale?
- what are partner teams and what they do?
- what are coworkers and when to go to them?
- expected difficulties or frictions in culture?

#### what is considered quality code?
maintable, stable and easy to change  
you should assume requirement will change  
trump "clever code" that is hard to read  
working code is better then clean code

use descriptive naming  
decoupled code  
single responsibility  
clear organization in folders  
  things that change together should stay together  
use comments appropriately  
avoid duplicattion  
test coverage and good tests

#### before adding new features:
if existing code is really bad:  
- add tests
- refactor
- then add

#### tests, TDD
if having list of requirements, make sure each has at least one test  
convention of starting name starting "should ..."

you can nest description blocks inside description  
to group similar

don't get overconcerned about %  
it can lead to another problem:  
writing tests that check implementation details  
which will be a problematic when refactoring  
(opposite to testing general functionality)

it's way harder to write tests after

TDD helps to not overplan implementation

#### refactoring
focus on one thing at a time  
rewrite one at a time  
be guided by tests

do small steps if possible  
keep it still working between steps  
so that you can ship it any moment

#### mimic inheritance with hash
```javascript
const handler = {
  "Aged Brie": (args) => {
    ...
  },
  "Sulfuras": (args) => {
    ...
  },
}

// then call:
handler[item.name](item);
```

#### presentations for devs
presentation should be different than normal work

don't aim for:  
"I'm going to show how it is to be me while coding"  
while coding feels great and you want to share  
... it's not something you can really share

have a good mix of live working and describing ideas  
remember to keep "work" parts relativelly short  
audience cannot stay top focused  
also it's acutally hard to follow and listen at the same time

don't aim for a lot of work during presentation  
and beeing real  
... it will result in frustration trying to follow you  
it may actually be better to skip some parts

don't ask big open questions (also avoid phylosophical questions)  
  like "what is a good code?"  
instead better be specific and perhaps closed:  
  is oauth refresh token usable one time?  
  oauth refresh token is usable one time and we have many tabs  
    who can see a problem?  
  .  
  who used X/Y  
  who recognizes this?  
  who knows what language this is written in?  
  what is a cpu registry?  
  can you see a problem with this solution?  
  what if we want to add X/Y to this solution?  
  prepare small, rewarding puzzles you can ask  
  play with audience  
    but from position of just a normal guy  
    don't pretend to know it all

don't be too fast  
better deliver less but with good tempo

#### working with existing code
use step debugger  
read and write new test  
_my idea: break things on purpuse to learn about code from how it broke_

### Communication
#### near deadline I know I need another month
probably you could signal this before  
ask for help from team, domain experts  
communicate blockers

there is some flexibility in tickets and scope  
keep regular updates for team  
Imposter syndrome makes this situation harder

#### Estimating
difficult  
many devs are scared by that  
a lot of devs get it wrong

make a spike to conquer some problems  
especially if there is some part with more questions

break down task  
also understand all timeframes for PR review + deployment

#### Communicating
what:  
what is done  
what is in-progress  
what are blockers  
what is at risk of not being delivered

to who  
manager  
teammates  
stakeholders

#### Gathering information
what is the task  
validation steps  
stakeholders

perhaps not all parts of your ticket are needed in the same moment  
make sure you deliver what was needed

#### Feedback loops
not helpfull to ask:  
  how am I doing?  
it's too general

so ask specific:  
I plan to skill up, would you have some suggestions in what tech/non-tech?

if you want to get promoted:  
  do you have ideas how can I take more responsibility  
  and expand my role

#### Asking for help
show your progress  
share you hypotesis  
be clear about assumptions, distinguish what you know from what you assume

#### Getting promoted
Is it enough to just work hard?  
No, other are too busy to notice.

You need to advocate for yourself  
make sure other are aware about your impact  
silence may be taken for being inactive  
own narration about your contribution  
share your successes

create regular communication loops with manager  
send to your manager what you have done

maintain a private brag doc  
extra points if you have metrics  
your actions, results

understand what is promotion process in your company  
you may need to attach a version of brag document to get promotion

hesistations:  
its arrogant  
something was a team effort, how I distill my part

books:  
How Women Rise  
What Got You Here Won't Get You There

#### Intentionally foster opportunities
how to increase opportunities  
how you have more opportunities come to you?  
networking  
build trust by always delivering  
hope that you will be recommended

also ask for responsibilities  
before getting them assigned

but also more: teamwork, collaboration  
case, a person:  
arrive early, leave late  
always deliver  
but he wasn't a good collabolator  
didn't get good with manager  
in one case ignored existing solution  
with time that person was given more side activities  
avoid problems:  
don't cut others in meeting  
don't always criticize other solutions  
avoid blaming, shaming  
create space for other people ideas

accumulation of opportunities lead to massive growth  
earn manager trust  
don't fight with other team members  
look for win-win for everyone involved  
deliver excelent work while fostering relations

when trying to get promoted relations will be very important  
it will be important are other vouching for your promotion

toxic manager  
one that intentionally gives you tasks that limits you  
... move to another team  
find a place where you will grow instead

what is a signal for promotion?  
when collagues are surprised you are not on "senior role"

but also try not trigger problems  
if you know you're working with difficult person  
let them not change your approach  
don't drag your personal problems with someone into group  
perhaps it's time to resolve problems at manager level

#### Mental trap: Good solutions speak for themselves
building technical excellent solutions is only half of work  
second half is making sure it is solving user problems

#### deliverying tools
solve main pain problems  
change rejection into curiosity  
at the end you should have adoption

#### building relatioships
face to face meetings  
it's important to see facial reactions

#### active listening
connection with other people doesn't rely on how you speak  
but how well are you listening  
have a genuine desire to get to get to know someone  
ask about parts that you are interested in  
but don't force to talk about something

cognitive: pay attention to all information, build picture in head  
emotional: stay calm and compassionate, filter judgement, annoyance, boredom  
behavioral: convey interst trough body and words

making the other person feel heard and understood

people will not tell you anything unless  
you create a space where they will feel safe  
no judgement  
no shame  
no blame

to be authentic is to be vulnerable

what  
why  
feelings: this is where connection is formed

we want to get to feelings, emotions  
this is often where conversation happen

but also we should give a way out when asking about emotions  
so "please don't answer if you don't feel comfortable ..."

#### when in company you don't understand some roles
engage people and tell them you're curious about their role  
offer to grab a coffe and have a 1:1 talk

#### technical vs soft
foundation is being a great coder  
but every social, communication skill on top is multiplier

#### corpo way to fight
keep record of actions of toxic person  
and evidence how it put down project and members  
and take it to manager

#### idea for resolving a conflict
find a common thing that we both want
